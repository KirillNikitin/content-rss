RSS parsing and news content render 

The aim is to decode content getted from 'https://www.readability.com/rseero/latest/feed' and render blocks of news upon this content.

Clicking on the evry single news block creates popup with full article. Full content of the article we are able to get via readibility API (parser API) using personal link of the news block (from rss xml) and personal user's token.

UI supports 2 screen width types - more, than 850px for desktop and less, than for 850px for pad's resolution and mobiles.
